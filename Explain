Got it 💡 You need a **speech script** that you can deliver in the hackathon — covering **data generation → analytics → model → Streamlit UI** in one flow. I’ll write it like a **storytelling pitch** you can use directly.

# 🎤 Hackathon Speech Script

---

### 🔹 1. Introduction

“Hello everyone,
Our project is a **Manufacturing Inventory Copilot** — an AI-powered system that helps planners and supervisors make faster and smarter supply chain decisions.

Since hackathons often don’t provide full ERP datasets, we first built a **synthetic dataset generator**. This ensures that our solution can be demonstrated end-to-end, without dependency on external systems, but still mimics real-world manufacturing complexity.”

---

### 🔹 2. Data Generation

“We generated data across **six key dimensions**:

1. **Suppliers** – 50 suppliers with lead times and quality ratings, just like real vendor master data.
2. **Inventory** – 200 unique parts, each with on-hand stock, reorder point, MOQ, and linked suppliers.
3. **Usage History** – 3 years of daily part consumption, simulated with **Poisson distributions** to model real-world random demand.
4. **Production Schedule** – Planned daily builds for different car models like Sedan, SUV, Truck, EV, and Luxury cars.
5. **BOM (Bill of Materials)** – Each model requires \~50 parts, so our system knows exactly which part is consumed when a car is built.
6. **Purchase Orders** – 2000 orders with status like *Open*, *Closed*, or *In Transit*, to simulate procurement flow.

Finally, all this is exported into a **single Excel file with six sheets**, which acts like our ERP system.”

---

### 🔹 3. Analytics Layer

“On top of this dataset, we built **analytics functions** that simulate what planners would ask:

* *Which parts are below reorder point?*
* *Which suppliers are causing the most shortages?*
* *What’s the 7-day demand forecast per part?*
* *Which parts are at risk of stockout next week?*

This transforms raw data into **actionable supply chain insights**.”

---

### 🔹 4. AI Model Choice

“For reasoning and natural language interaction, we integrated **DeepSeek V3**.

Why this model?

* It’s **fast and lightweight**, which is critical in a hackathon setup.
* It provides **structured reasoning**, so when you ask: *‘Which suppliers are risky for EV production next month?’* — the model can combine BOM, demand, supplier lead times, and inventory levels to give a contextual answer.

So the model isn’t just answering — it’s **reasoning across multiple data sources**.”

---

### 🔹 5. Streamlit UI (Copilot Experience)

“All of this comes together in our **Streamlit UI**, designed to feel like a **Copilot dashboard + chat assistant**:

* On the **left side**, we have filters, search, and quick actions like *View Shortages*, *Check Supplier Risk*, *Forecast Demand*.
* On the **main screen**, we show **interactive charts and tables** powered by Altair.
* At the bottom, there’s a **chat box** where the user can ask questions in plain English, like:

  * *‘Show me parts below reorder point from Supplier\_12’*
  * *‘Forecast shortages for EV production in next 14 days’*

The AI responds with both **answers + visualizations**, making decisions explainable and interactive.”

---

### 🔹 6. End Pitch

“In short, our solution combines:

* **Synthetic data generation** to simulate ERP, MES, and procurement data.
* **Analytics layer** for actionable insights.
* **DeepSeek V3 AI model** for reasoning and natural language queries.
* **Streamlit UI** for an interactive Copilot experience.

This makes our system not just a demo, but a **blueprint for an enterprise-grade AI planning assistant** in manufacturing.”

👉 This script is **end-to-end** — you can narrate it while showing your code, Excel, and Streamlit app.

Would you like me to also **trim this into a 2-minute sharp pitch** (for judges) and a **5-minute detailed walkthrough** (for teammates)?

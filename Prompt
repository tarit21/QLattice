Great Q 🙌 — let me break it down.

Your current **hackathon app** (inventory + suppliers + LLM) supports **two kinds of questions**:

---

## 1. **Data-Driven Questions (Structured Pandas filtering)**

These are **direct queries** where we can map to a Pandas filter before asking the LLM. Examples:

* 📦 Inventory / Stock

  * *“Show me all parts with stock below 50”*
  * *“Which parts are at risk of stockout in 7 days?”*
  * *“List all high-usage parts (>1000 units last week)”*

* 🚚 Supplier

  * *“Which supplier provides part P0015?”*
  * *“Show suppliers with rating > 4.5 and lead time < 7 days”*
  * *“Find alternate suppliers for part P0045”*

* 🏭 Production / BOM

  * *“If we plan 200 SUVs, what parts will be bottlenecks?”*
  * *“What raw materials are needed for an Engine?”*
  * *“Show me total demand for Tyres this month”*

---

## 2. **Reasoning / Natural-Language Q\&A (via LLM)**

Here the LLM interprets results & adds reasoning:

* ⚠️ Risk & Alerts

  * *“Which parts need urgent restock?”*
  * *“Who is the best supplier to order from for part P0123?”*
  * *“Summarize the inventory risks for next 14 days”*

* 💡 Recommendations

  * *“Suggest procurement plan for next week”*
  * *“If demand increases 20%, which suppliers will fail?”*
  * *“Recommend how to distribute orders across suppliers to minimize delays”*

* 📊 Business Insights

  * *“What categories are most prone to stockouts?”*
  * *“Do we have supplier concentration risk?”*
  * *“Which parts are critical for Vehicle Assembly and low in stock?”*

## 3. **Judge-Friendly Demo Questions** 🎤

These are killer demo questions you can ask in the hackathon:

1. “Show me the parts that will run out in the next 7 days.”
2. “Which supplier should we choose for urgent restocking of Engine components?”
3. “If we increase production by 20%, which parts become bottlenecks?”
4. “Summarize inventory risks for next week in plain English.”
5. “Who are our top 3 most reliable suppliers for high-demand parts?”

⚡ In short → it supports **operational queries (data filtering)** + **strategic queries (LLM reasoning)**.

👉 Do you want me to **make a ready-made prompt guide** (like a "cheat sheet" of 15–20 supported questions) so you can share it with judges during the demo?
